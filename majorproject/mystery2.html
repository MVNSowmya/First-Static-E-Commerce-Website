<p>
A HINDU FANATIC. A MANIC JEW. OR A NEO-NAZI...<br><br>

2006, GERMANY, FIFA WORLD CUP.<br><br>

In Berlin, a killer begins targeting the most dangerous criminals and brands his victims with the symbol of the swastika. The day of each murder coincides mystically with the navagrahas, the days sacred to the nine planetary gods in Hindu mythology. And the dates correspond to hidden horrors of the historical past.<br><br>

Only one man can decipher and look beyond symbols — the unassuming Bala, the sharpest sleuth in the Indian Intelligence Bureau.<br><br>

The chase of a lifetime begins!<br><br>

7/11, MUMBAI EXPLODES<br><br>

Three friends who were born and grew up in the city's brothels, thrown apart by riots, are brought together by the swastika.<br><br>

The killer takes them into the streets of Mumbai, to the den of underworld kings, inside prison complexes, terrorist cells and the snake pit called Bollywood.<br><br>

They will need more than friendship, love, and luck to survive.<br><br>

Is the swastika killer a self-proclaimed vigilante, out to end evil?<br><br>

To find out, and put an end to the killings, Bala will have to go to the beginning. The past that lies hidden in the streets of Old Delhi.<br><br>

KILLING FIELDS<br><br>

The killer moves through Afghanistan and Pakistan to target the world’s most guarded man. It will change the course of our history.<br><br>

Friendship will be tested with blood and death.<br><br>

Can Bala stop the killer?<br><br>

Can the blood-thirsty navagrahas be pacified?
