Data Structures Using C is a textbook written for the undergraduate engineering students studying Computer Science. Authored by Aaron M. Tenenbaum, Yedidyah Langsam, and Moshe J. Augenstein, this book is meant for those students who wish to learn the art of creating efficient data structures using C. This handbook teaches the readers the steps to be followed for enhancing program execution using data structures. To make it easier and more accessible for the readers, the authors discuss the data structure development process from its theoretical conception and talk about all the steps involved till the concrete realization. The book focuses on structured design and programming techniques. Data Structures Using C informs readers of various alternate implementations of data structures as well, thereby enhancing their knowledge. A detailed discussion has been included here on the tradeoffs that are used to choose a particular approach. The several debugged programming examples incorporated in the book help the readers get a better understanding of the subject. Moreover, the authors have described complete development of all programs along with the graphic representation of material. The book covers all the crucial topics such as the stack, recursion, queues and lists, trees, graphs and their applications, and storage management. The readers will find the sorting and searching algorithms useful in this updated version of the book.
