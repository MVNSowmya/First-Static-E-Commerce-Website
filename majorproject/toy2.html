Plastic Material<br><br>
Multicolor<br><br>

The Fisher-Price Rock-a-Stack is a game that is based on simple design that can be enjoyed by young children. The base is designed to provide a rocking action that will swing to and fro when hit by the baby. The Rock-a-Stack is suitable for both boys and girls while also being suitable for children under the age of 2 years. Your baby can learn how to stack the rings based on size and color on the base. Stack the rings up without the base to let your baby knock it down and a lot of fun. The Fisher-Price Rock-a-Stack helps develop your kids motor skills and improve their hand-eye coordination. The bright colors and different sizes of the rings help your baby understand what colors are and how to grasp objects in their tiny hands.
